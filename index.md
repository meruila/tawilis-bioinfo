# Tawilis Bioinformatics
by [Mirella Arguelles](https://github.com/meruila).
Inspired by [Ronan Harrington](https://github.com/rnnh)'s [Bioinformatics Notebook](https://rnnh.github.io/bioinfo-notebook/).  
Contributors: Keem Uarren Eiryll B. Antonio, 

This notebook documents the tools used in the Tawilis Multi-omics Project. The project is divided into three components: Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Methylomics. Each component has their own pipeline, found at their respective chapters. Some tools may be reused in different subprojects (e.g., QC implemented in all three subprojects) but may have slight differences in their usage. 

For any questions or concerns, kindly email Mirella at [mirarguelles@gmail.com](mailto:mirarguelles@gmail.com).
